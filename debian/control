Description: Lightweight in-process concurrent programming
 The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that
 supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently
 (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with
 data exchanges on "channels".
 A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
 micro- thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other
 words. This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code
 runs. You can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of
 greenlet; however, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as
 a way to make advanced control flow structures. For example, we can
 recreate generators; the difference with Python's own generators is
 that our generators can call nested functions and the nested
 functions can yield values too. Additionally, you don't need a
 "yield" keyword. See the example in tests/test_generator.py.
